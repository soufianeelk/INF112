HOW-TO import all the files into your project (Eclipse IDE)
=============================================================

As a starting point, you are given a file archive (.tgz) containing some java files.
This is how to import them into your Eclipse environnement :

1) Extract the archive into your working directory : 
tar xvf thisArchive.tgz

2) Launch Eclipse and create a new Java project

3) Import all the files into your src source folder :
Import ... -> File System : select all the sub-folders in the src folder of the decompressed archive
*WARNING* : don't select / deselect the option "create top-level folder"
